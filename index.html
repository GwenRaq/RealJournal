	    	<h2> My First Blog Entry</h2>
	    	<h6>Aug 15, 2016</h6>
	    	<p> 
	      		I took this class because I want to be a Computer Engineer. I wanted to experience things that a computer can do like coding. I was also interested in coding when I heard about it from a field trip and when I heard it in the Library.
	    	</p>
	    	<p> 
	      		Something that I want to get out of this class is that I want to be able to know all the basics of coding. I also want to know how to use coding programs like Java. I also want to be able to acomplish a project. For example, making a project or an app.

			<h2>HTML</h2>
			<h6>August 23,2016</h6>
			<p>
				I learned how to make an html website. I made the website with Sublime Text and Git Shell. First, I learned the git commands which are git add, git commit -m, git status, and git push. Git add means your adding a specific file to sublime text. Git commit means you're initializing the project. Git status is for checking your projects status and git push means that you're uploading everything 	into your respository.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, I learned some of the basics or components for putting a website together on sublime text. I leanrned how to make a paragraph element, a closing tag, a header, a block element, an inline element, how to add an image, and how to make a closing tag.

			<h2>UX vs UI</h2>
			<h6>August 24,2016</h6>
			<p>
				UX stands for User Experience. It enhances the inability between the user and a product. It makes the product more fun to use and interactable. It is what the user will interact with. It also requires organization.
			</p>
			<p>
				UI stands for User Interface. It is the graphical design of the site, the visual element, and what you will see in the site.

			<h2>Responsive and Mobile Design</h2>
			<h6>October 7, 2016</h6>
			<h4>Responsive Design</h4>
			<p>
				A responsive design is building a site to respond to multiple sizes also known as fluid design. So when you make the window smaller, the website will also become smaller to fit the window. It won't cut of any of its properties. An example of it would be Facebook, Google, and beta.rallyinteractive.com. 
			</p>
			<h4>Mobile Design</h4>
			<p>
				A mobile design is a web app design for mobile devices. Media queries makes the design effective for a mobile. An example is Instagram. A Media Query is break points in css that tells your app to change according to screensize. 
			</p>

			<h2>DigimonGo</h2>			
			<h6>October 7, 2016</h6>
			<p>
				I learned a lot of things while I was making the DigimonGo website. I learned how to change the font of the texts, how to change the color when you hover over a text, how to add a photo through css and that you can change the location of it on css. It was really fun making the DigimonGo website even though it kind of gave me stress. I was proud of myself when I finished it.  
			</p>

		<div id="sixth" class="content">
			<h2>Media Queries </h2>
			<h6>October 7, 2016</h6>
			<p>
				I learned that media queries is the break points in css that tells your app to change according to screensize. It changes the width of the screen depending on how big or small your device is. I learned how to make it by making a family block. I think that I also had a lot of fun making this, seeing the colors change and blocks change when you make the screen smaller.

			<h2>Basic Javascript</h2>
			<h6>November 2, 2016</h6>
			<p>
				While I was learning the javascripts basics, it was really hard for me to understand. I wasn't sure what we were making. After a couple of practices I kind of understood a some of it but I'm still kind of lost. I learned how to make a string, a function, variables, etc. I also learned how to make a conditional statement which I think is really fun to read and make.

			<h2>Conditional (Aliens)</h2>
			<h6>November 2, 2016</h6>
			<p>
				I was surprised that conditional statements were also used in coding. I thought it was only used in math or science. I was glad that I had some background ideas of what a conditional statement was through math team. It helped me a lot while Zedrick and I were solving the aliens assignment. I think if I never learned how to solve a conditional statement, I wouldn't have solved it. I had a lot of fun figuring out how many red, green, and blue aliens there were and I also had fun writing the conditional statement for java.

			<h2>Verizon App Challenge Review</h2>
			<h6>November 28, 2016</h6>
			<p>
				1.Our problem that we wanted to fix was that we think school lacks communication, especially towards people's clubs. We wanted people's voices to be heard. 
			</p>
			<p>
				2. We would improve our video by adding more interview scenes since we only had 1 interview. We also needed to add the features of the phone and how it works.
			</p>
			<p>
				3. Our current features are that there are group chats where the number of people could range from 1 to 50 people. Lunch menu from the school and there's a survey that people could take so that we could change the school by the people's opinions. Reminders are also sent to the club users or from the people's classes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				4. I would like to add a feature where it could motivate people to go to their clubs or do their homeworks/club works. Something like what the other teammates remoji app can do.
			</p>
			<p>
				5. The challenges that our team faced was that we didn't have enough time to do the videos and our schedules were tight so we were only able to meet on certain days. We also needed to edit the videos better and cut the scenes on the right time. Since the editing from the first scene wasn't that good and there were some scenes missing, we had to re-edit it.
			</p>
			<p>
				6. Next time I would try to encourage the team to try to meet up more so that we could complete the video. Also, I would try to help the person editing because they seemed like they needed help.

			<h2>Semester Summary</h2>
			<h6>December 19, 2016</h6>
			<p>
				This semester was pretty fun for me. I learned a lot of things from creating websites like Journals, DigimonGo, Blocks, and Bob the Builder. My favorite activity was creating the blocks. The blocks assignment was really fun because it was really cool and exciting for me to see the background color and texts change colors when you make the website bigger or smaller. After I learned about it, I couldn't wait but include it to my Journal.</p>
			<p>
				We didn't only learn about css or creating websites but we also learned about JavaScript. The first time we were learning JavaScript, I didn't know what was going on. I didn't understand a thing that was happening in class. But thanks to my friends, they were able to help me understand about it better and I was able to do well in making the assignment without anyones help. I also did really well on the test and I was glad I received a lot of help from my friends and teachers. I was rally happy afterwards and JavaScript started becoming fun to me. I enjoyed making the fortune cookie generator because I just love seeing things change color and do something when you click on a button.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Another thing that happened during this semester was creating the Verizon App Challenge. That was kind of fun to do especially making the video. It was really funny seeing everyone act and I enjoyed acting too. Unfortunately, I don't think our video was good enough for us to win. I wanted to make it better, but our schedules were tight and we didn't have enough time to finish them.
